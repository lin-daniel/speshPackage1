            <p class="lead">A small suburb that many of us consider safe is defined by the titles of high-tech companies nearby. This town that almost 60,000 of us call home is so secure and understated that it’s referred to as the little bubble of Cupertino. But even in the tranquil community of Cupertino, crime is still prevalent. Whether it be thefts in the locker rooms of MVHS, shoplifting or home burglaries, some students indulge in the adrenaline rush of crime.

            <p class="lead">
                In this interactive package, El Estoque explores crime and illegal activity in Cupertino, from robberies in our neighborhoods to a place that students wander through every day — MVHS. From thefts to illegal substance abuse and how MVHS’ administration combats these problems, this is a look at crime within the bubble of Cupertino.

                    The people of Cupertino often refer to their city as an isolated community or a bubble because of its low crime rate, high concentration of Asian-Americans and scholarly background. However, Cupertino isn’t as pure and safe as most believe it to be. Crime in Cupertino is a highly overlooked topic, as most assume Asians aren’t associated with criminal activity. In reality, most crime that occurs within the city are caused by outsiders who pass by.
The map below shows criminal incidents that have occurred in the Cupertino area in the past week.</p>

                    Although we may only hear about locker room crooks on campus, others have ventured from the locker rooms to stores, dabbling in the realm of shoplifting along with 27 million other individuals in our nation.* Three anonymous seniors share their reasons behind stealing, the day they got caught and why they decided to, at the end, simply own up to their actions. These are the stories of those who reveled in the adrenaline rush of that dangerous edge, those who loved the feeling of being able to have anything they wanted and forgot the consequences that were drowned by a sense of invincibility.

            <p class="lead"> Clean, large streets and no traffic. Those were Jackson Hu’s first impressions of America when he immigrated to the United States from Taiwan in the early 1980’s. Jackson explains that there was tension between Taiwan and China at that time and his family was worried that Jackson and his brothers would be drafted into the war and torn from the family. But in America, that wouldn’t happen.</p><p class="lead">Click on the image below to read about a family's experiences in Taiwan and America.</p>
